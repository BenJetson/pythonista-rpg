# pythonista-rpg
This repo contains the RPG game for the Pythonista project. 

-- Game Execution --

To run the game, run the 'game_engine.py' file using the Python interpreter. 

For the game to run properly, all files contained in the downloaded archive 
  should be stored in the same directory, and your Python Shell should be 
  running from the directory of the stored files. Otherwise, execution 
  will fail with an exception.

-- System Requirements --

Operating System: Any OS that supports Python > v2.5
Python Version: A minimum version of 2.5 of the Python interpreter is required 
  for the game to run. However, version of 3.0 or newer is recommended for the 
  most optimal and best experience/performance.
